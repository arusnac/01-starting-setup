# Expense-Tracking
Built following a tutorial on Udemy.

This is a web application that allows the user to track expenses. It contains a form where they input the expense, which is then displayed on the same page.
It also features a filter to show how much was spent each month of a specific year.

**What I would do differently**

To make this more useful I would link it to a database.
I would also add more reporting futures to make it a more fully-fledged expense tracking application. How much was spent for a specific category for example.
